# Liraz's login-page-react-redux 

This project was built with consideration of being part of a much larger project, I tried to make it scalable as possible and therefore redux and redux saga was implemented.
The login form is dynamic for the same reason, I wanted to demonstrate how to build components for being reused and easyly integrated as this project will grow.

## Installation

```bash
npm install
```
